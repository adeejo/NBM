# Normal Behaviour Model (NBM) for Wind Turbine SCADA data. 
Parameters of data are pre-processed for seasonality,lag and outlier detection<br />
Pre-processed data is modeled using LSTM algorithm in the Keras package<br /> 
Data was trained using 80% and tested using 20% testing<br />
Accuracy was measured using RMSE
